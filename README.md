# Baxter-Chess
## Introduction
This project is focused on developing a solution using Python, ROS, Gazebo, and RViz. The main goal is to enable Baxter, the robot, to play a simplified version of chess.

### Key Features
- **Chess Piece Manipulation**: Baxter can pick and place chess pieces.
- **Chessboard Setup**: Using ROS, Baxter autonomously sets up the chessboard with predefined states.
- **Predefined Chess Moves**: Baxter performs a series of hardcoded chess moves during the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Latest version of the provided virtual machine with essential ROS packages.
